            From the inner temple, a part of the Inns of Court, the manciple is in charge of providing supplies to lawyers living there. Despite being illiterate (ironic since he is surrounded by lawyers at the inns) and part of the middle class, the Manciple is very business savvy, able to sweep the better deal from learned men. 

            However, the Manciple has a twisted side to him as he insults the cook and makes the intoxicated cook drink more wine when the cook threatens to go through the Manciple’s financial records. This implies that the reason the Manciple is so successful financially is that he commits fraud and messes with the books. 
            
            Another interesting element is looking at the tale the Manciple tells. The Manciple’s Tale is a retelling of a tale from Ovid’s Metamorphoses.  It talks about the origin of the crow, a literary staple in English literature. Just like the crow, the Manciple is a cunning figure. 
             
            As for description, there is no description of the Manciple though illustrations have portrayed him like the image above. Chaucer likely viewed the Manciple as a sly fellow who was clever and deceptive.

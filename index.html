            From the inner temple which is a part of the Inns of Court. Is a college manciple. Despite being illiterate, the manciple was very business savvy, able to sweep the better deal from learned men. 

            However, the Manciple seems to have a twisted side to him as he insults the cook and makes the intoxicated cook drink more wine when the cook threatens to go through the Manciple’s financial records. This implies that the reason the Manciple is so successful financially is that he commits fraud and messes with the books. 
            
            Another interesting element is looking at the tale the Manciple tells. The Manciple’s Tale is a retelling of a tale from Ovid’s Metamorphoses.  It talks about the origin of the crow, a literary staple in English literature. Just like the crow, the Manciple seems to be a cunning figure.
